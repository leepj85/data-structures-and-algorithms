# LinkedList Insertion

## Challenge
* Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
  * .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
  * .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
  * .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Approach & Efficiency
wrote code & tested.

## API
 * append(T value)
 * insertBefore(T value, T newVal)
 * insertAfter(T value, T newVal)
