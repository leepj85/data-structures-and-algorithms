# Singly Linked List
Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node. Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  * Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
  * Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
Implemented Node class and then LinkedList class, completing each feature noted in challenge above.

## API
  * insert() - Takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * includes() - Takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.
  * toString() - Takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.
