# Challenge Summary
Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge Description
* Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
  * enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  * dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
* The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.
